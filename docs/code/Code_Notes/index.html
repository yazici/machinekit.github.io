<p>This document is a collection of notes about the internals of Machinekit. It
is primarily of interest to developers, however much of the information
here may also be of interest to system integrators and others who are
simply curious about how Machinekit works. Much of this information is now
outdated and has never been reviewed for accuracy.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>'AXIS' - An axis is one of the nine degrees of freedom that define a tool
position in three-dimensional Cartesian space. Those nine axes are
referred to as X, Y, Z, A, B, C, U, V, and W. The linear orthagonal
coordinates X, Y, and Z determine where the tip of the tool is
positioned. The angular coordinates A, B, and C determine the tool
orientation. A second set of linear orthagonal coordinates U, V, and W
allows tool motion (typically for cutting actions) relative to the
previously offset and rotated axes.</p>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>Unfortunately “axis” is also
sometimes used to mean a degree of freedom of the machine itself, such
as the saddle, table, or quill of a Bridgeport type milling machine. On
a Bridgeport this causes no confusion, since movement of the table
directly corresponds to movement along the X axis. However, the
shoulder and elbow joints of a robot arm and the linear actuators of a
hexapod do not correspond to movement along any Cartesian axis, and in
general it is important to make the distinction between the Cartesian
axes and the machine degrees of freedom. In this document, the latter
will be called 'joints', not axes. (The GUIs and some other parts of
the code may not always follow this distinction, but the internals of
the motion controller do.)</pre>
</div>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>'JOINT' - A joint is one of the movable parts of the machine. Joints are
distinct from axes, although the two terms are sometimes (mis)used to
mean the same thing. In Machinekit, a joint is a physical thing that can be
moved, not a coordinate in space. For example, the quill, knee, saddle,
and table of a Bridgeport mill are all joints. The shoulder, elbow, and
wrist of a robot arm are joints, as are the linear actuators of a
hexapod. Every joint has a motor or actuator of some type associated
with it. Joints do not necessarily correspond to the X, Y, and Z axes,
although for machines with trivial kinematics that may be the case.
Even on those machines, joint position and axis position are
fundamentally different things. In this document, the terms 'joint' and
'axis' are used carefully to respect their distinct meanings.
Unfortunately that isn&#8217;t necessarily true everywhere else. In
particular, GUIs for machines with trivial kinematics may gloss over or
completely hide the distinction between joints and axes. In addition,
the ini file uses the term 'axis' for data that would more accurately
be described as joint data, such as input and output scaling, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>'POSE' - A pose is a fully specified position in 3-D Cartesian space. In the
Machinekit motion controller, when we refer to a pose we mean an EmcPose
structure, containing three linear coordinates and three angular ones.</p>

<p>There are four components contained in the Machinekit Architecture: a motion
controller (EMCMOT), a discrete IO controller (EMCIO), a task executor
which coordinates them (EMCTASK) and several text-mode and graphical
User Interfaces. Each of them will be described in the current
document, both from the design point of view and from the developers
point of view (where to find needed data, how to easily extend/modify
things, etc.).</p>

<p>Machinekit software architecture. At the coarsest level, Machinekit is a
hierarchy of three controllers: the task level command handler and program
interpreter, the motion controller, and the discrete I/O controller. The
discrete I/O controller is implemented as a hierarchy of controllers,
in this case for spindle, coolant, and auxiliary (e.g., estop, lube)
subsystems. The task controller coordinates the actions of the motion and
discrete I/O controllers. Their actions are programmed in conventional
numerical control "G and M code" programs, which are interpreted by
the task controller into NML messages and sent to either the motion or
discrete I/O controllers at the appropriate times.</p>

Layer). This document assumes that the reader has a basic understanding
of the HAL, and uses terms like HAL pins, HAL signals, etc, without
explaining them. For more information about the HAL, see the
HAL Manual. Another chapter of this document will
eventually go into the internals of the HAL itself, but in this
chapter, we only use the HAL API as defined in src/hal/hal.h.</p>

<p>The following figure is a block diagram
of a joint controller. There is one joint controller per joint. The
joint controllers work at a lower level than the kinematics, a level
where all joints are completely independent. All the data for a joint
is in a single joint structure. Some members of that structure are
visible in the block diagram, such as coarse_pos, pos_cmd, and
motor_pos_fb.</p>

<p>The above figure shows five of the
seven sets of position information that form the main data flow through
the motion controller. The seven forms of position data are as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>'emcmotStatus-&gt;carte_pos_cmd' - This is the desired position, in
Cartesian coordinates. It is updated at the traj rate, not the servo
rate. In coord mode, it is determined by the traj planner. In teleop
mode, it is determined by the traj planner? In free mode, it is either
copied from actualPos, or generated by applying forward kins to (2) or
(3).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>'emcmotStatus-&gt;joints[n].coarse_pos' - This is the desired position, in
joint coordinates, but before interpolation. It is updated at the traj
rate, not the servo rate. In coord mode, it is generated by applying
inverse kins to (1) In teleop mode, it is generated by applying inverse
kins to (1) In free mode, it is copied from (3), I think.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>'emcmotStatus-&gt;joints[n].pos_cmd - This is the desired position, in
joint coords, after interpolation. A new set of these coords is
generated every servo period. In coord mode, it is generated from (2)
by the interpolator. In teleop mode, it is generated from (2) by the
interpolator. In free mode, it is generated by the free mode traj
planner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>'emcmotStatus-&gt;joints[n].motor_pos_cmd' - This is the desired position,
in motor coords. Motor coords are generated by adding backlash
compensation, lead screw error compensation, and offset (for homing) to
(3). It is generated the same way regardless of the mode, and is the
output to the PID loop or other position loop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>'emcmotStatus-&gt;joints[n].motor_pos_fb' - This is the actual position, in
motor coords. It is the input from encoders or other feedback device
(or from virtual encoders on open loop machines). It is "generated" by
reading the feedback device.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>'emcmotStatus-&gt;joints[n].pos_fb' - This is the actual position, in joint
coordinates. It is generated by subtracting offset, lead screw error
compensation, and backlash compensation from (5). It is generated the
same way regardless of the operating mode.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>'emcmotStatus-&gt;carte_pos_fb' - This is the actual position, in Cartesian
coordinates. It is updated at the traj rate, not the servo rate.
Ideally, actualPos would always be calculated by applying forward
kinematics to (6). However, forward kinematics may not be available, or
they may be unusable because one or more axes aren&#8217;t homed. In that
case, the options are: A) fake it by copying (1), or B) admit that we
don&#8217;t really know the Cartesian coordinates, and simply don&#8217;t update
actualPos. Whatever approach is used, I can see no reason not to do it
the same way regardless of the operating mode. I would propose the
following: If there are forward kins, use them, unless they don&#8217;t work
because of unhomed axes or other problems, in which case do (B). If no
forward kins, do (A), since otherwise actualPos would <em>never</em> get
updated.</p>

<h2 id="commands">Commands</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This section simply lists all of the commands that can be sent to the
motion module, along with detailed explanations of what they do. The
command names are defined in a large typedef enum in
emc2/src/emc/motion/motion.h, called cmd_code_t. (Note that in the
code, each command name starts with 'EMCMOT_', which is omitted here.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The commands are implemented by a large switch statement in the
function emcmotCommandHandler(), which is called at the servo rate.
More on that function later.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are approximately 44 commands - this list is still under
construction.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="abort">ABORT</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The ABORT command simply stops all motion. It can be issued at any
time, and will always be accepted. It does not disable the motion
controller or change any state information, it simply cancels any
motion that is currently in progress.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_1" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</sup></p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="requirements">Requirements</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>None. The command is always accepted and acted on immediately.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="results">Results</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In free mode, the free mode trajectory planners are disabled. That
results in each joint stopping as fast as its accel (decel) limit
allows. The stop is not coordinated. In teleop mode, the commanded
Cartesian velocity is set to zero. I don&#8217;t know exactly what kind of
stop results (coordinated, uncoordinated, etc), but will figure it out
eventually. In coord mode, the coord mode trajectory planner is told to
abort the current move. Again, I don&#8217;t know the exact result of this,
but will document it when I figure it out.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="free">FREE</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The FREE command puts the motion controller in free mode. Free mode
means that each joint is independent of all the other joints. Cartesian
coordinates, poses, and kinematics are ignored when in free mode. In
essence, each joint has its own simple trajectory planner, and each
joint completely ignores the other joints. Some commands (like JOG)
only work in free mode. Other commands, including anything that deals
with Cartesian coordinates, do not work at all in free mode.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="requirements-2">Requirements</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The command handler applies no requirements to the FREE command, it
will always be accepted. However, if any joint is in motion
(GET_MOTION_INPOS_FLAG() == FALSE), then the command will be ignored.
This behavior is controlled by code that is now located in the function
'set_operating_mode()' in control.c, that code needs to be cleaned up.
I believe the command should not be silently ignored, instead the
command handler should determine whether it can be executed and return
an error if it cannot.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="results-2">Results</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the machine is already in free mode, nothing. Otherwise, the
machine is placed in free mode. Each joint&#8217;s free mode trajectory
planner is initialized to the current location of the joint, but the
planners are not enabled and the joints are stationary.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="teleop">TELEOP</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The TELEOP command places the machine in teleoperating mode. In teleop
mode, movement of the machine is based on Cartesian coordinates using
kinematics, rather than on individual joints as in free mode. However
the trajectory planner per se is not used, instead movement is
controlled by a velocity vector. Movement in teleop mode is much like
jogging, except that it is done in Cartesian space instead of joint
space. On a machine with trivial kinematics, there is little difference
between teleop mode and free mode, and GUIs for those machines might
never even issue this command. However for non-trivial machines like
robots and hexapods, teleop mode is used for most user commanded jog
type movements.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="requirements-3">Requirements</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The command handler will reject the TELEOP command with an error
message if the kinematics cannot be activated because the one or more
axes have not been homed. In addition, if any joint is in motion
(GET_MOTION_INPOS_FLAG() == FALSE), then the command will be ignored
(with no error message). This behavior is controlled by code that is
now located in the function 'set_operating_mode()' in control.c. I

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="coord">COORD</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The COORD command places the machine in coordinated mode. In coord
mode, movement of the machine is based on Cartesian coordinates using
kinematics, rather than on individual joints as in free mode. In
addition, the main trajectory planner is used to generate motion, based
on queued LINE, CIRCLE, and/or PROBE commands. Coord mode is the mode
that is used when executing a G-code program.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="requirements-4">Requirements</h4>

several more SET commands as more parameters are added. I would like to
find a cleaner way of setting and reading configuration parameters. The

nearly identical for every parameter.</p>

<p>libnml is derived from the NIST rcslib without all the multi-platform
support. Many of the wrappers around platform specific code has been
removed along with much of the code that is not required by Machinekit. It is
hoped that sufficient compatibility remains with rcslib so that
applications can be implemented on non-Linux platforms and still be
able to communicate with Machinekit.</p>

<p>This chapter is not intended to be a definitive guide to using libnml

<div class="paragraph">
<p>At the heart of libnml is the CMS class, it contains most of the
functions used by libnml and ultimately NML. Many of the internal
functions are overloaded to allow for specific hardware dependent
methods of data passing. Ultimately, everything revolves around a
central block of memory (referred to as the 'message buffer' or just
'buffer'). This buffer may exist as a shared memory block accessed by
other CMS/NML processes, or a local and private buffer for data being
transferred by network or serial interfaces.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The buffer is dynamically allocated at run time to allow for greater
flexibility of the CMS/NML sub-system. The buffer size must be large
enough to accommodate the largest message, a small amount for internal
use and allow for the message to be encoded if this option is chosen
(encoded data will be covered later). The following figure is an
internal view of the buffer space.</p>

<div class="footnote" id="_footnote_1">
<a href="#_footnoteref_1">1</a>. It seems that the higher level code (TASK and above) also use ABORT to clear faults. Whenever there is a persistent fault (such as being outside the hardware limit switches), the higher level code sends a constant stream of ABORTs to the motion controller trying to make the fault go away. Thousands of 'em&#8230;&#8203;. That means that the motion controller should avoid persistent faults. This needs to be looked into.
